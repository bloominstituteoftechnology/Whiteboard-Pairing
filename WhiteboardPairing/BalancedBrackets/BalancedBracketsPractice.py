# Start a formula that takes in the string of variables.
# Iterate over the characters in the string.
# Keep track of each of the types of characters, + for open, - for close.
# Check the values for each of the characters to see if they are 0 or not.
# If all are zero, return true.
# If not zero, return false.
# return character_counter + character_counter + character_counter == 0
