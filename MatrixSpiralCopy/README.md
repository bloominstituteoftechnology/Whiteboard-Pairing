# Matrix Spiral Copy

Given a 2D array (matrix) `inputMatrix` of integers, create a function `spiralCopy` that copies `inputMatrix`’s values into a 1D array in a clockwise spiral order. Your function then should return that array. 

Analyze the time and space complexities of your solution.

Examples:
```
input:  inputMatrix  = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
                        [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
                        [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
                        [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
                       ]

output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 11, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 13, 12]
