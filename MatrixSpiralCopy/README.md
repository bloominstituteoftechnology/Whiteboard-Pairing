# Matrix Spiral Copy 

Given a 2D array (matrix) `inputMatrix` of integers, create a function 
`spiralCopy` that copies `inputMatrix`â€™s values into a 1D array in a clockwise 
spiral order. Your function then should return that array. 

Examples:
```
input:  inputMatrix  = [
                        [1,  2,  3,  4,  5],
                        [6,  7,  8,  9,  10],
                        [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
                        [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
                       ]

output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 11, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 13, 12]
```
