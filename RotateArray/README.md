# Rotate Array

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

## Example:

```python
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3

Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Explanation:

rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
```
